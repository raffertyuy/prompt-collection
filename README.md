This folder contains prompts collected from various sources including (but not limited to):
- [Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel)
- [Lang Chain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain)
- Awesome ChatGPT Prompts ([here](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts) and [here](https://www.awesomegptprompts.com/))
- my personally created prompts
- and more...

Since it's easy to test and compare outputs of prompts versus different models using [Prompty](https://prompty.ai), my goal for this repo write most of the prompts in this format.
