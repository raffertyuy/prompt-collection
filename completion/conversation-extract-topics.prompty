    We discussed the new marketing strategy for Q3. Jane proposed focusing on digital channels, especially social media campaigns on Instagram and TikTok. Mark suggested we should allocate at least 30% of our budget to traditional media like TV and radio. Everyone agreed that we need to hire a dedicated content creator for our YouTube channel. The campaign should launch by August 15th.
