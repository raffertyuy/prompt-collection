    John: Hi team, let's discuss the upcoming product launch.
    Mary: I've finished the marketing materials. We're ready on that front.
    Alex: The development team needs another week to fix some critical bugs.
    John: Can we postpone the launch by one week then?
    Mary: That works for marketing. We can use the extra time for additional social media promotion.
    Alex: Yes, development can commit to having everything ready by then.
    John: Great, then it's settled. We'll launch on May 15th instead of May 8th.
